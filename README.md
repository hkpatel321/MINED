DESCRIPTION : 

This repository provides a backend solution for extracting text from research papers (PDF format), summarizing it, and converting it into a PowerPoint presentation (PPT). Additionally, the repository generates graphical abstracts (data visualizations) based on extracted research data.

Features:
Text Extraction: Extracts text from PDF files using PyMuPDF.
Summarization: Uses the Gemini Pro AI model to generate a summarized version of the research paper.
Graphical Abstract Generation: Creates data visualizations using Matplotlib (bar charts, graphs).
PowerPoint Creation: Automatically generates a PowerPoint presentation with summarized content and graphical abstracts using python-pptx.
Tools & Libraries Used:
PyMuPDF (fitz): For extracting text from PDFs.
Gemini Pro AI: For text summarization.
Matplotlib: For generating basic graphical abstracts (charts, graphs).
python-pptx: For creating PowerPoint presentations.
Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
A Gemini Pro API key for summarization. (Sign up for Gemini Pro to get an API key).
Install the Required Libraries:
You can install all required dependencies using pip. Run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install google-generativeai fitz matplotlib python-pptx
Setup & Usage
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:



python
Copy
Edit
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
Step 3: Prepare Your Research Paper PDF
Ensure that you have a PDF of the research paper you'd like to process. Place the PDF in the same directory as the script or provide the path to it.

Step 4: Run the Script
Run the Python script to generate the PowerPoint presentation and graphical abstract:

bash
Copy
Edit
python generate_ppt.py
Step 5: Output
After running the script, the output will be a PowerPoint (.pptx) file named research_presentation.pptx in the same directory. This PowerPoint file will contain:

A title slide with the paper's title.
A slide with summarized text from the paper.
A slide with the graphical abstract (bar chart representing example data).
You can modify the create_graphical_abstract function to handle different types of data visualizations as per the research paper content.

Example Code Flow
Extract Text: The script extracts the text content from the research paper PDF using PyMuPDF (fitz).
Summarize Text: The text is sent to Gemini Pro to generate a concise summary suitable for a PowerPoint presentation.
Generate Graphical Abstract: The script creates a simple bar chart using Matplotlib to represent example research data (this can be customized).
Create PowerPoint: A PowerPoint presentation is generated using python-pptx, containing the summarized text and graphical abstract.

Notes:
Make sure to modify the create_graphical_abstract function if you want to use more advanced data visualization tools (e.g., Plotly, Seaborn).
You may want to add error handling for edge cases like empty PDFs, missing text, or data inconsistencies.
